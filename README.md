# DetectText

Connect with 3 Cloud providers for detecting text from images. Choose the best default provider based on your use cases. 

Using this code requires having accounts for Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. It also requires having access keys for Google Cloud Vision, Azure Computer Vision, and AWS Rekognition on the corresponding platforms.

Please reference config.example.json to create a file config.json that contains access keys and other configurations. 

Image archiving and email sending functionality is implemented with AWS S3 and SES in this example.
